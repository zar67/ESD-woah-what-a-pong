#### Additional Feedback
> This is a very good effort. There are some issues with the gameplay. The ball often gets stuck and the it's starting velocity is way to vertical. The speed could be improved a little and a larger font loaded. The codebase is solid and easy to read. All memory is being managed properly, but functions could be shorted and some additional classes could have been used.  This is a good effort well done.
